# HIBERNATE FRAMEWORK

* Framework for mapping object oriented domain to relational database
* Maps Java classes to database tables
* Maps from Java data types to SQL data types
* Generates SQL calls and handles object conversion of the result set

#### MAPPING (from java classes to database tables)

* Configuration stored in xml or java annotations
* Objects in a front-end application follow OOP principles, while objects in the back-end follow database normalization principles, resulting in different representation requirements. This problem is called `object-relational impedance mismatch`. Mapping is a way of resolving the object-relational impedance mismatch problem.
