# IDEA

* make an improved external knowledge store
* stores all my acquired knowledge in something like wiki format
* only accessed through 2 level authentification system
* redundant storage with possible vertical scaling
* hosted on dedicated server with static ip at home


* Issues with current GIT  storage:
  * Not good idea to store sensitive info
  * Is only good for text files
  * Everything is ready, so there is no learning
